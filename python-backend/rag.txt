// UI JUMP TO VIDEO
I am building a UI for a YouTube RAG-based Q&A system.

Backend response contains:
1. An AI-generated answer (string)
2. An array of timestamps, where each timestamp represents a different part of the video used to generate the answer.

Each timestamp object looks like:
{
  "start_time": number (seconds),
  "end_time": number (seconds)
}

UI Requirements:

1. Display the AI answer normally as text.
2. Show ONE main button labeled: "Jump to video".
3. When the user clicks this button, open a small dropdown / popover / modal (UI choice is yours).
4. Inside this dropdown, list ALL timestamps (converted to HH:MM:SS format).
5. Each timestamp should be clickable.
6. When a timestamp is clicked, open the YouTube video at that exact start_time using:
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID&t=START_TIME
7. Do NOT auto-jump the user to any timestamp.
8. Do NOT merge or average timestamps.
9. The user must explicitly choose which timestamp to jump to.
10. The UI should be simple, clean, and user-friendly.

Focus on good UX and clarity.


==================================
Backend already returns:
- Clean AI answer text
- Raw timestamps in seconds (start_time, end_time)

Frontend expectations:
1. Display the answer text as-is.
2. Convert timestamp seconds to HH:MM:SS on frontend.
3. Show ONE button: "Jump to video".
4. On click, open a dropdown / popover listing ALL timestamps.
5. Each timestamp must be clickable.
6. On click, open YouTube video at that exact timestamp.
7. Do not auto-jump or merge timestamps.
8. Backend formatting logic should NOT be repeated on backend; only frontend handles display formatting.

======================================
State management
❌ No timeout for stuck processing
❌ No retry mechanism for failures
❌ No progress tracking (user doesn't know how long)
❌ No race condition handling (multiple users same video)
❌ No cleanup for old/failed videos

============================================
✅ OPTION 1 — Frontend polling (MOST COMMON)

Frontend does:
Call /query
If response = PROCESSING
Wait 3–5 seconds
Call /query again automatically






=================================================
SQL querying :

sqlite3 video_state.db

UPDATE video_states
SET status = 'FAILED',
    error = 'testing auto repair'
WHERE video_id = 'EV7WhVT270Q';

SELECT video_id, status, error, languages
FROM video_states
WHERE video_id = 'Z3D2UmAesN4';

.quit
